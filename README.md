# Google-Code-In-Projects
All the projects that I worked on for Google Code-In 2020

# [Physics time! Where the aircraft will be?](https://github.com/nsr-py/Google-Code-In-Projects/blob/master/Physics%20time!%20Where%20the%20aircraft%20will%20be%3F.py) 
This was also as easy task:

The task was to predict the final location of the flight given its initial parameters and time delay. I created a flight object for that and the rest was just basic application of simple physics (Also, I was asked to not take into account acceleration. But I do not think that that would had complicated things in anyway)

# [Space Bound Computation (Python) - Fedora Project](https://github.com/nsr-py/Google-Code-In-Projects/blob/master/Space%20Bound%20Computation.py) 
The goal of this task was simple:

"Change the order of looping (i, j to j, i) and see if time for computation changes. Play around with numpy functions (ravel) and understand the concept of row major and column major ordering. Plot the time vs input size graph for this computation and compare it with the graph obtained in the previous task."

It actually  helped me get to know more about the ravel function
