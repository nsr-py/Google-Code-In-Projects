# Space Bound Computation (Python) - Fedora Project 
The goal of this task was simple:

"Change the order of looping (i, j to j, i) and see if time for computation changes. Play around with numpy functions (ravel) and understand the concept of row major and column major ordering. Plot the time vs input size graph for this computation and compare it with the graph obtained in the previous task."

It actually  helped me get to know more about the ravel function
